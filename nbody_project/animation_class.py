    INPUT PARAMETERS:
    -----------
    r : array-like
        The position of the particles as r = [x,y,z]. Can also be set to 0 if you want uniform random integer positions generated between 0 and the size of the grid.

    v : array-like
        The velocities of the particles as v = [vx,vy,vz]. Can also be set to 0 if you want uniform random integer velocities generated between -1 and 1.

    m : array-like
        The mass of the particles (set to 1 for all particles for ease, but can be changed).

    G : int
        Value of Newton's Gravitational Constant that you would like to use

    npart : int
        The number of particles in the simulation.

    softening : float
        The value of epsilon added into our force law such that our simulation does not act weird at large potentials.

    size : int
        The size of the grid within which you want to generate particles.

    dt : float
        Size of the time steps to take.

    bc_type : string
        Sets whether we are going to use periodic or non-perioud boundary conditions. "periodic" meaning periodic and "normal" meaning non-periodic.
